# Astro + TailwindCSS Startkit

## Why

There are many startkit for astro with TailwindCSS, but most of them render the style code into pages an components, which means there will be a lot duplicated in-line css code, and also this might not good for SEO.

So this repo render all necessary style code into a single css file, and link it from `index.html`.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
